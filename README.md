# UFOs
Use JavaScipt,HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

# Tools i use;
- JavaScript as primary coding language 
- HTML used to manipulation,form validation, and dynamic changes of content
- CSS  used to control presentation,fomating and layout the webpage
- VScode as an editer
- Chrome-browser to run the webpage and display certain functions or interactive search elements


# Overview of Project

# Purpose

 Dana webpage and dynamic table want more in-depth  analysis of UFO sightings by allowing filter for multiple criteria at the same time like add table filter for the date, city,country, and shape.


# Results
- how someone might use the new webpage by using the search criteria?
    - first i created a table to organize UFO data that is stored in a javaScript array, or a list, then the table would have the ability to filter data based on search criteria and would be created using javaScript as primary coding language. After i Created we could populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Also i customized my webpage using Bootstrap, and equip my table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Here are some images below to perform the search;

# Summary

   Some drawback of using this webpage are client-side security, browser support and lack of debugging facility. I recommend further development to solve those problemes, it needs more modern core javascript and web API features.
